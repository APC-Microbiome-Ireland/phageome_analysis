CC  This HMM describes a clade within the family PF00107 of zinc-binding dehydrogenases. The family PF00107 contains class III alcohol dehydrogenases, including enzymes designated S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase and NAD/mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase. Members of the current family occur only in species that contain the very small protein mycofactocin (TIGR03969), a possible cofactor precursor, and radical SAM protein TIGR03962. We name this family for Rxyl_3153, where the lone member of the family co-clusters with these markers in Rubrobacter xylanophilus.
