CC  This model describes protein repeat with a well-conserved motif ELWxxDGT, and a periodicity of about 48. A single protein may have as many as 18 repeats. It may consist nearly entirely of this repeat, or may have other repeats as well (e.g. hyalin repeat). It is most common in the Deltaproteobacteria.
