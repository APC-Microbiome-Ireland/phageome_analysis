CC  Sequences found by this model are the so-called product template (PT) domain of various fungal iterative type I polyketide synthases. This domain resembles PF14765, designated polyketide synthase dehydratase by Pfam, but members of that family are primarily bacterial, where type I PKS are predominantly modular, not iterative. The dehydratase active site residues well-conserved in PF14765 (His in the first hot dog domain, Asp in the second hot dog domain) seem well conserved in this family also.
