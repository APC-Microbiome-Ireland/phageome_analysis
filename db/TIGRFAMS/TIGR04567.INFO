CC  Members of this family are the RNA polymerase delta subunit, as found in the Firmicutes and the Mollicutes. All members of the seed alignment have an extended C-terminal low-complexity region, consisting largely of Asp and Glu, that is not included in the model. Proteins giving borderline scores should be checked to confirm a similar acidic C-terminal domain.
