CC  Members of this family resemble cytochrome P450 by homolog, but lack a critical heme-binding Cys residue. Members in general are encoded next to a glycosyltransferase gene in a natural products biosynthesis cluster, physically interact with it, and help the glycosyltransferase achieve high specificity while retaining high activity. Many members of this family assist in the attachment of a sugar moiety to a natural product such as a polyketide.
