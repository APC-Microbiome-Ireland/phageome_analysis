CC  Members of this protein are short (about 85-residue), low-complexity sequences of unknown function, with a highly hydrophobic N-terminal region of about 40 amino acids followed by a charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg-rich), sometimes repetitive C-terminal region. Members occur exclusively among the Mollicutes (Mycoplasma, Mesoplasma, Acholeplasma, Spiroplasma, Entomoplasma). The gene neighborhood of this protein is not conserved.
