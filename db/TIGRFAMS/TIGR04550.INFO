GS  mmoD
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family are MmoD, a protein that binds the soluble (as opposed to the membrane-bound, copper-rich, particulate) methane monooxygenase and may regulate its activity. Recent work suggests that MmoD, together with methanobactin, acts a copper switch to regulate which enzyme form is produced.
