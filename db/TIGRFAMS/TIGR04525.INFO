EN  IgG-blocking protein M
TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family, including MG_281 of Mycoplasma genitalium, bind conserved regions of the IgG light chain sequences, blocking IgG's normal function of antigen-specific binding. It is therefore an important virulence protein. Members of this family are found also in  Mycoplasma pneumoniae, M. penetrans, M. gallisepticum, and M. iowae. Model TIGR04524 describes a region within this protein that is shared by many additional Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma proteins.
