CC  This model defines a domain restricted to Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma proteins. Members include protein M of Mycoplasma genitalium, MG_281, a virulence protein that binds the IgG light chain to block the binding of antibody to antigen. The crystal structure of the protein M antibody-binding region is solved (PDB|4NZR), and includes this homology domain. Full-length homologs to MG_281 are known in a few other Mycoplasma species, but this model's seed alignment demonstrates distant homology to many additional proteins with a much wider distribution across the Mollicutes. Member proteins include paralogous families in some species, such as MCAP_0345, MCAP_0347, MCAP_0349, and MCAP_0351 in Mycoplasma capricolum.
