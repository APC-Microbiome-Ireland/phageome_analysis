CC  Members of this family are putative virulence proteins of Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma species. Members share a region of sequence similarity (see TIGR04524) with protein M, a Mycoplasma genitalium protein that binds a conserved light chain region of IgG and blocks its protective function of antigen-specific binding. The seed alignment for this model includes an N-terminal signal-anchor domain and a proline-rich linker domain, and a C-terminal extension, in addition to the protein M-like domain recognized by TIGR04524.
