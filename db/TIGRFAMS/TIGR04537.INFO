CC  This model describes a diverse region of extremely small size (11 residues), so unavoidably there are both false-positives and false-negatives. All true hits should occur in proteins encoded next to an encapsulating protein (see PF04454), and should occur near the extreme C-terminus. Families previously known to have this domain on some members to mediate encapsulation include dye-decolorizing peroxidases and a ferritin-like protein, but (as this model helps show) there are others, including some hemerythrin family proteins and novel family TIGR04536.
