TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members resemble the peptide maturation dehydrogenase SagB of thiazole and oxazole modification systems, and occur in a what appears to be a new type of peptide modification system. One adjacent marker is a new type of nitrile hydratase alpha subunit-related putative precursor, TIGR04509, distantly related the NHLP leader peptide family TIGR03793. Another is a large protein, TIGR04510, with regions similar to adenylate cyclases and TPR proteins.
