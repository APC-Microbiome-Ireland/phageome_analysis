CC  Members of this family belong to the iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase family (see PF00465). The NADP(H) cofactor is bound too tightly for exchange (although non-convalently), so enzymatic activity depends on a second substrate or electron carrier. The radical SAM-modified natural product mycofactocin is proposed to fill this role. In Rhodococcus erythropolis N9T-4, a role was shown for this protein in CO2 fixation during extreme oligotrophic (or possibly chemoautotrophic) growth.
