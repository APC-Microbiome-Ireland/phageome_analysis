CC  Members of this protein family are found exclusively in the Cyanobacteria, usually encoded next to a gene encoding cyanoexosortase B (TIGR04156). This relationship resembles the association of the unrelated protein family TIGR04153 with cyanoexosortase A (TIGR03763), and of most exosortases with EpsI.
