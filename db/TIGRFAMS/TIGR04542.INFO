CC  This model describes a set of dehydrogenases belonging to the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase (GMC oxidoreductase) family. Members of the present family are restricted to the bacterial genus Gordonia, and seem to replace the related family TIGR03970, which occurs in Actinobacteria generally but not in the genus Gordonia. Members of both this family and TIGR03970 are associated with the mycofactocin biosynthesis operon in Actinobacteria.
