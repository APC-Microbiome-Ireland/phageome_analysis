CC  The enzyme modelled by this HMM can convert crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA (crotonyl-CoA reductase activity), but more importantly, in the presence of CO2, generates (2S)-ethylmalonyl-CoA. In serine cycle methylotrophic bacteria this enzyme is involved in the process of acetyl-CoA to glyoxylate [1,2]. In other bacteria the enzyme is used to produce extender units for incorporation into polyketides such as tylosin from Streptomyces fradiae [3] and coronatine from Pseudomonas syringae [4].
