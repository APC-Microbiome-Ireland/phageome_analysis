TP  TIGRFAMs
CC  Members of this family average 110 residues in length, with strong N-terminal homology to both the nitrile hydratase (NH) alpha subunit and family TIGR03793 of NH-related ribosomally translated natural product precursors. A neighboring gene resembles SagB, the dehydrogenase of many thiazole and oxazole modified peptide systems, supporting the hypothesis that members of this family are post-translationally modified.
