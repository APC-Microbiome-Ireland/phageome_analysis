CC  This protein is the small subunit for exodeoxyribonuclease VII. Exodeoxyribonuclease VII is made of a complex of four small subunits to one large subunit. The complex degrades single-stranded DNA into large acid-insoluble oligonucleotides. These nucleotides are then degraded further into acid-soluble oligonucleotides.
