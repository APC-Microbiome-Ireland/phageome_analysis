CC  This family of proteins is restricted to the Mollicutes (including Mycoplasma, Spiroplasma, and Ureaplasma). Members belong to a superfamily of multiple membrane-spanning proteins, among which those with assigned activities function as the S component (the specificity component) of ECF transporters. However, members fail to score better than the trusted cutoffs to previously built models for S component proteins (see Pfam family PF07155).
