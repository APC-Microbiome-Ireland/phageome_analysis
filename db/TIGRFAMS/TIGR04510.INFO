CC  Members of this family show homology to mononucleotidyl cyclases and to tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins. Members occur in next to two other markers of ribosomal peptide modification systems. One is a dehydrogenase related to SagB proteins from thiazole/oxazole modification systems. The other is the putative precursor, related to the nitrile hydratase-related leader peptide (NHLP) and nitrile hydratase alpha subunit families. These systems occur in many species of Xanthomonas and Stenotrophomonas, among others.
