CC  This model describes a minimally characterized protein family, restricted to bacteria excepting for some eukaryotic sequences that have possible transit peptides. YebC from E. coli is crystallized, and PA0964 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been shown to be a sequence-specific DNA-binding regulatory protein. In silico analysis suggests a role in Holliday junction resolution.
