CC  Members of this family occur as paralogs in most Mycobacterium strains, including 2 in M. tuberculosis, 6 in M. avium, and 9 in M. smegmatis. Members have a cleaved N-terminal signal peptide and exactly two Cys residues in the mature protein, both at invariant positions. The best characterized member, Rv0203, is a hemophore, that is, a secreted polypeptide that binds heme and delivers it to a transport system for import. Hemophores are protein analogs of siderophores, natural products that chelate non-heme iron and deliver it to receptors for transport. The unrelated HasA family of hemophores has been described in Gram-negative bacteria such as Yersinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
