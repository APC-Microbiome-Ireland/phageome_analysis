CC  Members of this family, including Rv0203 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are secreted heme-binding proteins used in heme acquisition. Such proteins are called hemophores. Members have a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, and a mature region just over 100 amino acids long with a pair of invariant Cys residues. An unrelated hemophore, HasA, occurs in Gram-negative pathogens such as Yersinia pestis.
