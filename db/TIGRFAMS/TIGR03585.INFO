CC  Sequences in this family are members of the PF00583 (GNAT) superfamily of acetyltransferases and are proposed to perform a N-acetylation step in the process of pseudaminic acid biosynthesis in Campylobacter species [1].  This gene is commonly observed in apparent operons with other genes responsible for the biosynthesis of pseudaminic acid and as a component of flagellar and exopolysaccharide biosynthesis loci.  Significantly, many genomes containing other components of this pathway lack this gene, indicating that some other N-acetyl transferases may be incolved and/or the step is optional, resulting in a non-acetylated pseudaminic acid variant sugar.
