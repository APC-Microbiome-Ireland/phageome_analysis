CC  Members of this family contain two tandem copies of a domain described by Pfam HMM PF02381. This protein often is found with other genes of the dcw (division cell wall) gene cluster, including mraW, ftsI, murE, murF, ftsW, murG, etc. Recent work shows MraW in E. coli binds an upstream region with three tandem GTGGG repeats separated by 5bp spacers. We find similar sites in other species.
