CC  Members of this family are AhbD (alternative heme biosynthetic protein D), a radical SAM enzyme in sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens that performs the last decarboxylations to synthesize heme b from Fe-coproporphyrin III. Members include DVU_0855, previously included in error in TIGR04055, the NirJ2 family thought to be involved in heme d1 biosynthesis.
