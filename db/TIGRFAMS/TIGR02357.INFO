CC  Members of this protein family have been assigned as thiamine transporters by a phylogenomic analysis of families of genes regulated by the THI element, a broadly conserved RNA secondary structure element through which thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) levels can regulate transcription of many genes related to thiamine transport, salvage, and de novo biosynthesis. Species with this protein always lack the ThiBPQ ABC transporter. In some species (e.g. Steptococcus mutans and Streptoccus pyogenes), yuaJ is the only THI-regulated gene. Evidence from Bacillus cereus indicated thiamine uptake is coupled to proton translocation. However, a more recent comprehensive study of energy-coupled factor (ECF) transport suggests this protein is the S (subtrate capture) component of an ECF system, meaning it is energized by ATP. Previously YuaJ, but renamed ThiT.
