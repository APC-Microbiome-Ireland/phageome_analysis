CC  This domain, about 100 amino acids long, occurs in Actinobacteria and other little-studied Gram-negative bacteria, Sec-dependent proteins 300-800 in length. The domain is rich in aromatic residues, with Trp, Tyr, or Phe as the majority amino acid in ten of the twenty-four most-conserved residue positions.
