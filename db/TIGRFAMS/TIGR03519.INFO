CC  This HMM describes a protein family unique to, and greatly expanded in, the Bacteriodetes. Species in this lineage include several, such as Cytophaga hutchinsonii and Flavobacterium johnsoniae, that have type IX secretion systems (T9SS) and exhibit a poorly understood rapid gliding phenotype. Several members of this protein family are found in operons with other genes whose loss leads to a loss a this motility.
